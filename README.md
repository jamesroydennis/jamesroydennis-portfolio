# James Roy Dennis — Professional Portfolio

This repository serves as my **professional engineering portfolio**.

Its purpose is to present **applied, real‑world system design and automation work** in a way that is clear, inspectable, and directly aligned with problems faced by employers and customers.

---

## Portfolio Intent

This portfolio is **not a theory archive** and **not an institutional site**.

It exists to demonstrate:

* Practical systems architecture
* Automation‑first engineering
* Problem‑driven technical decision‑making
* Clear translation between requirements, constraints, and implementation

Where appropriate, deeper architectural or research work (e.g., PortusSophia™) is referenced as **background**, not as a prerequisite for understanding the work here.

## Real‑Time Demo Focus: Healthcare Interoperability

A core component of this portfolio is an **applied, real‑time demonstration** addressing a common and costly healthcare IT problem:

> *Fragmented clinical data caused by misalignment between LOINC, SNOMED CT, and FHIR representations.*

### The Problem Employers and Customers Face

Healthcare systems routinely struggle with:

* Inconsistent clinical terminology across systems
* Brittle mappings between LOINC and SNOMED CT
* FHIR resources that validate syntactically but fail semantically
* High manual cost to maintain terminology alignment
* Downstream analytics and clinical decision errors

These issues surface as:

* Integration delays
* Data quality incidents
* Regulatory and compliance risk
* Lost engineering time

---

## Demonstration Objective

The demo in this portfolio is designed to show **how these systems can converge cleanly**:

* **LOINC** — observational and measurement semantics
* **SNOMED CT** — clinical concept grounding
* **FHIR** — interoperable resource exchange

The emphasis is on:

* Automated validation
* Repeatable mappings
* Clear failure modes
* Governance‑aware constraints

This is an **engineering demonstration**, not a whitepaper.

## What This Demonstrates

Through code, configuration, and automated validation, this portfolio shows:

* How to design interoperability pipelines that fail safely
* How to reduce manual terminology reconciliation
* How governance constraints can be encoded into systems
* How CI pipelines can validate healthcare data transformations continuously

The focus is on **how the system behaves under change**, not just how it looks when everything is correct.

---

## How to Read This Repository

* Start with the **problem framing** in each section
* Review the **system assumptions and constraints**
* Inspect the **automation and validation logic**
* Observe how errors are detected and surfaced

Everything here is designed to be readable by:

* Senior engineers
* Architects
* Technical leads
* Healthcare IT stakeholders

## Relationship to PortusSophia™

PortusSophia™ is a long‑running systems architecture and integrity project that informs how I think about governance, automation, and system boundaries.

This portfolio applies those principles **directly and concretely** to real‑world engineering problems.

No familiarity with PortusSophia™ is required to evaluate the work here.

---

## Status

This portfolio is **actively curated**.

Content is added deliberately to reflect:

* Applied engineering capability
* Real problem domains
* Clear technical signal
