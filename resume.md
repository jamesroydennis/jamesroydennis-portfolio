## Professional Summary

Senior systems architect and engineer with deep experience designing automation‑heavy, governance‑aware systems that remain coherent under pressure. Known for building and validating complex architectures through continuous integration and verification rather than manual execution. Strong at translating ambiguous, high‑risk problem spaces into testable systems, resilient workflows, and maintainable structures.

Currently developing PortusSophia™, a long‑running systems architecture and integrity project demonstrating sustained CI‑driven validation, automation density, and structural clarity.
