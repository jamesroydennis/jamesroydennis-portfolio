---

## Roles to Approach with Caution

These roles may **under-level** or misalign with demonstrated capability:

* Generic "Software Engineer II" roles
* Compliance-only or audit-only positions
* Pure policy or documentation roles without engineering authority
* Founder-only startup roles during IC hiring cycle

---

## Geographic & Market Considerations (21224)

* Baltimore/DC corridor supports strong salaries, but **remote-first companies often pay more competitively**
* Healthcare, government-adjacent, and regulated industries are strong fits
* Cost-of-living adjusted offers **should not dip below national senior IC medians**

---

## Salary Positioning Guidance

When asked about expectations, a grounded response is:

> *“Based on senior IC scope, automation-heavy systems work, and market data, I’m targeting roles in the $145k–$175k base range, depending on responsibilities and total compensation.”*

This anchors high **without overreaching**.

---

## Closing Assessment

Given qualifications, demonstrated work, and market conditions:

* **Senior IC roles are fully justified**
* **Competitive compensation is warranted**
* **Under-leveling should be actively avoided**

This document reflects a **fair, defensible employment posture** grounded in evidence, not aspiration.
